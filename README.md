🎓 Student Progress Tracker (C++ / FLTK)A robust, self-contained desktop application for tracking academic performance, built with modern C++ and the FLTK GUI toolkit.📖 OverviewThe Student Progress Tracker is an Object-Oriented C++ application designed to bridge the gap between teachers and students. It provides a secure, local environment where:Teachers can manage student rosters, create subjects, and record detailed assessments (grades & feedback).Students can visualize their academic growth through interactive charts and review feedback.The project emphasizes clean OOP Architecture (Polymorphism, Composition, Aggregation), Data Persistence (custom file-based database), and Zero-Dependency Deployment (FLTK is fetched automatically).✨ Key Features👨‍🏫 For TeachersRoster Management: Add new students dynamically via the dashboard.Subject Management: Create global subjects (e.g., "Mathematics", "Computer Science") available for assignment.Assessment Tracking:Record grades, total marks, and qualitative feedback.Update Capability: Correct mistakes in previous assessments easily.Data Isolation: Multiple teachers can teach the same subject name to the same student without data collision. (e.g., Math (Mr. Smith) vs Math (Ms. Doe)).👨‍🎓 For StudentsVisual Dashboard: View performance bar charts for every enrolled subject.Feedback View: Read detailed comments from teachers for specific assignments.GPA/Average Calculation: Real-time calculation of overall performance percentages.🛠 Technical HighlightsSelf-Contained Database: Uses a structured file system (data/ folder) instead of SQL, making it portable and easy to debug.Modern CMake Build: Uses FetchContent to download and compile FLTK on the fly—no manual library installation required.Robust Error Handling: Safe inputs for numerical fields and corruption-resistant file loading.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe project follows a strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern adapted for desktop GUI.1. The Model (Logic Layer)Person (Abstract Base): Defines common attributes (ID, Name, Email).Teacher / Student: Derived classes implementing specific roles.Subject: Contains assessments. It is owned by a Student but linked to a specific Teacher ID for data integrity.Assessment: Stores individual grade data.2. The Controller (App Logic)App Class: A Singleton controller that orchestrates the application lifecycle. It owns the master data vectors and manages screen switching.FileManager: A static utility class that handles serialization/deserialization of data into the custom directory structure.3. The View (GUI Layer)LoginWindow: Entry point validation.TeacherDashboard: Complex UI with Dropdowns (Fl_Choice), Popups (Fl_Window), and Browsers (Fl_Hold_Browser).StudentDashboard: Read-only view with Fl_Tabs and Fl_Chart.📂 Data Storage StructureThe application acts as its own database engine. Data is stored in plain text for transparency:ProjectRoot/
